DJ OPERAND will be a calculator that plays beats.  I'll
start with basic calculator function and a beatbox UI
and slowly build in sounds / extra functions.  Some cool
stuff i'd like to have :

-robust upper display that models after beatbox UI 
and updates top row while cascading previous calculations 
downward. 

-gadgets in the upper display
    -line graph from recent values 
    -current OPERAND
    -looper?
    -etc

-differnt sound packs

-light/dark mode
